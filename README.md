# AI-bot-tictacoe
This is an AI bot against which you can play tic-tac-toe! 

However, the only possible outcomes for any round are either the opponent AI's victory or a draw between both players. This is because the decision-making capabilities of the bot have been optimized using a minimax function. The minimax function seeks to minimize the loss involved when the opponent selects the strategy that gives maximum loss.
