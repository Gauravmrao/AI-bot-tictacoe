# AI-bot-tictacoe
This is an AI bot against which you can play tic-tac-toe! 

However, the only possible outcomes for any round are either the opponent AI's victory or a draw between both players. This is because the decision-making capabilities of the bot have been optimized using a minimax function. The minimax function seeks to minimize the loss involved when the opponent selects the strategy that gives maximum loss. 

# TO PLAY:
First, make sure you have python installed on your machine. Clone the repository, and then run the "runner.py" file. This file can be run via the Command Line by navigating to the directory in which it is saved and executing:

python runner.py

After this a game window should open up for you to play against the bot. Have fun!
